## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges globally, affecting every continent. Understanding the spread of the virus, its impact on different regions, and the effectiveness of vaccination programs is crucial for managing public health responses and preparing for future health crises. The objective of this project is to analyze the global spread of COVID-19, including infection rates, death counts, and vaccination efforts, and to correlate these with various socio-economic indicators such as the Human Development Index (HDI).
## Project Overview
This project utilizes a comprehensive dashboard to analyze and visualize the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key components of the dashboard include:

 - Global Infection Rates Map: A visual representation of COVID-19 infection rates across different countries, highlighting the intensity and spread of the virus globally.
 - New Cases Per Million: A line graph illustrating the trajectory of new COVID-19 cases per million people in various countries, providing insights into how the virus has evolved over time from 2020 to 2024.
 - Death Counts Per Country: A bar chart showing the total COVID-19 related deaths in major affected countries, allowing for a direct comparison of the pandemic's lethality across different regions.
 - Vaccinations vs. Human Development Index: A scatter plot analyzing the relationship between the percentage of the population fully vaccinated and the Human Development Index (HDI) of each country, exploring how socio-economic factors influence vaccination rates.
 - People Fully Vaccinated: A bubble chart displaying the total number of people fully vaccinated in key countries, emphasizing the scale of vaccination efforts in populous nations.
The results from this dashboard aim to provide actionable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to enhance their understanding of the pandemic's dynamics, improve response strategies, and optimize vaccination drives globally.
